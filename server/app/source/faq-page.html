        <h1>FAQ</h1>
      </div>
      <p>
        <h2>Can anyone cook on Gigamunch?</h2> Anyone who wants to use Gigamunch to sell food must go through an approval process. The approval process includes an interview to learn about the potential cooks food experience and motivations for sharing their food. The process also includes
        a local, state, and federal background check to ensure the safety of customers. Lastly, the Gigamunch team will make kitchen visits to further develop a trusting relationship with the cooks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h2>How does a cook sell their food exactly?</h2> Once cooks are approved they will be able to create posts on the Gigamunch app. The cooks will set the price, description, and other relevant information. Using the app, you will be able to see and buy their posted foods.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h2>Where does my money go?</h2> When you purchase a meal 80% of your money will go to the cook. The other 20% will go to Gigamunch to help us maintain operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h2>How do you get the food?</h2> There are three main ways to get your food.
        <ol>
          <li>Pick up the food from the cook's home.</li>
          <li>Get the food delivered to you by a delivery service, or by the cooks themselves.</li>
          <li>Pick up the food at an agreed upon location.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
