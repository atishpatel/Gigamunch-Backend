        <li>DISCLOSURES</li>
        <section>
          <p>
            THE SERVICES COMPRISE AN ONLINE MARKETPLACE THROUGH WHICH LOCAL CHEFS MAY CREATE MEAL LISTINGS AND USERS MAY LEARN ABOUT THE MEAL LISTINGS AND SCHEDULE PURCHASE AND PICKUP OR DELIVERY OF THE MEAL(S). YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT GIGAMUNCH IS NOT A PROVIDER OF
            FOOD SERVICES OR DOES NOT FUNCTION AS A BUSINESS THAT SELLS FOOD AND BEVERAGES. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GIGAMUNCH IS NOT A PARTY TO ANY AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO BETWEEN CHEFS AND USERS. GIGAMUNCH HAS NO CONTROL OVER THE CONDUCT OF CHEFS, USERS AND
            GIGAMUNCH ACCOUNT HOLDERS OF THE SERVICES AND DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY IN THIS REGARD TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
          </p>
          <p>
            CHEFS SHOULD UNDERSTAND HOW THE LAWS, RULES AND/OR REGULATIONS WORK IN THEIR RESPECTIVE STATES AND CITIES (COLLECTIVELY, "JURISDICTIONS"). SOME JURISDICTIONS HAVE LAWS, RULES AND/OR REGULATIONS THAT MAY LIMIT A CHEF'S ABILITY TO PROVIDE MEALS AND/OR FOOD
            SERVICES. THESE LAWS, RULES AND/OR REGULATIONS CAN BE PART OF A JURISDICTION'S ADMINISTRATIVE, AGRICULTURE AND/OR HEALTH CODES. IN MANY JURISDICTIONS, CHEFS MUST REGISTER, GET A PERMIT, AND/OR OBTAIN A LICENSE BEFORE PROVIDING MEALS OR ENGAGING IN AND/OR
            PROVIDING THE SERVICES. CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS MAY PROHIBIT CHEFS FROM ENGAGING IN AND/OR PROVIDING THESE SERVICES ALTOGETHER. STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS VARY GREATLY IN HOW THEY ENFORCE THESE LAWS, RULES AND/OR REGULATIONS. PENALTIES MAY INCLUDE FINES
            OR OTHER ENFORCEMENT. CHEFS SHOULD REVIEW ALL STATE AND LOCAL LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS BEFORE USING THE SERVICES. A CHEF IN TENNESSEE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT HE OR SHE EMPLOYS NO REGULAR, FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES, THE FOOD PREPARED FOR SELLING TO MUNCHERS IS
            SOLELY PERFORMED WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THE PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE OF THE PROPRIETOR, AND HE OR SHE DOES NOT PAY FOR ADVERTISING AND CHEF MAKES ONLY “OCCASIONAL SALES” DURING ANY GIVEN THIRTY-DAY PERIOD.

            YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, BY ACCESSING OR USING THE WEBSITE, APP OR SERVICES, OR BY DOWNLOADING OR POSTING ANY CONTENT FROM OR ON THE WEBSITE, VIA THE APPLICATION OR THROUGH THE SERVICES, YOU ARE INDICATING THAT YOU HAVE READ, AND THAT YOU UNDERSTAND
            AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE REGISTERED WITH THE SERVICE OR HAVE A GIGAMUNCH ACCOUNT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, THEN YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO ACCESS OR USE THE WEBSITE, APP AND SERVICES.
          </p>
          <p>
            You acknowledge and agree that you alone are responsible for any and all Meals that you provide through the Website, App and Services. Accordingly, you represent and warrant that any Meal you post and any Meal provided by Chef via the Website, App and
            Services will be in compliance with all applicable laws, tax requirements, and rules and regulations that may apply to any Meals listed or included via the Service, Website and App that you post (including having all required permits, licenses and registrations).
            Please note that Gigamunch assumes no responsibility for a Chef's compliance with any agreements with or duties to third parties, applicable laws, rules and regulations. You acknowledge and agree that as a Chef you are responsible for your own acts
            and omissions. Gigamunch reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to any Meals posted for any reason, including Meal postings that Gigamunch, in its sole discretion, considers objectionable for any reason,
            in violation of these Terms or otherwise harmful to the Website, App or Services.

            Gigamunch makes a significant effort to require Chefs to describe each Meal accurately on our Services. However, since the Meals are prepared by Chefs and not Gigamunch, a Meal may not look or taste exactly how it was described or depicted. You understand
            that this is normal, and you agree to accept such a Meal, regardless of variation from its description or depiction. We cannot and do not guarantee the accuracy of any description or depiction of any Meal. We reserve the right to change or update any
            such description or depiction and to correct errors, inaccuracies, or omissions at any time without giving you notice.

          <p>
            Gigamunch does not endorse any Chef or Meal and Gigamunch does not represent that a Meal is suitable or safe for your consumption. By using the Services, you agree that any legal remedy or liability that you seek to obtain for actions or omissions of
            other Members or other third parties will be limited to a claim against the particular Member or other third parties who caused you harm. You agree not to attempt to impose liability on or seek any legal remedy from Gigamunch with respect to such actions
            or omissions.
