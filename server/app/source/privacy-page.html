      <p>Last Updated: July 13, 2015</p>
      <p>This Privacy Policy describes how information about you is collected, used and disclosed by OmniNexus Inc. d/b/a Gigamunch and its subsidiaries and other affiliates (collectively "Gigamunch") when you access or use the Website, App, our Services or otherwise interact with us. Any capitalized terms used by but not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning set forth in the Terms of Service. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, you must not use our Website, App, or our Services. By using our Website, App, or our Services, you agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p>Gigamunch reserves the right to change or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and in our sole discretion. If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will provide notice of such changes, such as by sending an email notification, providing notice through the Websites or updating the “Last Updated” date at the beginning of this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy whenever you use or access the Websites or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.</p>
      <p>Collection of Information</p>
      <p>We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we collect information when you register for a Gigamunch account, participate in any interactive features of our Services, or communicate with us via third party social media sites, request customer support or otherwise communicate with us through other platforms.</p>
      <p>Mobile Device Information: We collect information about the mobile device you use to access or use the App, including the hardware model, operating system and version, mobile network information, browser type and version, time zone setting, traffic data, location data, logs, communication data and the resources that you access and use on or through the App browser plug­in types and version, unique device identifiers such as MAC addresses and IP addresses, mobile network information and information about your use of the App. We may also assess metadata and other information associated with other files stored on your device. This may include, for example, photographs, audio and video clips, personal contacts and address book information.</p>
      <p>Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Devices: Like many website operators and mobile ­application operators, we use automated data collection tools such as Cookies and Web Beacons to collect certain information. With your consent, we may also collect real­time information about the location of your mobile device and access and collect information from certain native applications on your device (such as your device's camera and photo album) to facilitate certain features of the App. If you do not want us to collect this information you may opt­ out by adjusting the settings of your mobile device. Note, however, that opting out of the App's collection of location information will cause its location ­based features to be disabled and certain other functions of the App to not function properly. For more information about how you can control the collection of location information and/or our access to other applications on your device, please see contact us at team@gigamunchapp.com</p>
      <p>"Cookies" are small text files that are placed on your hard drive by a Web server when you access our Services. We may use both session Cookies and persistent Cookies to identify that you’ve logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use Cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent Cookies, session Cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept Cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting Cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept Cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third­-party services providers that we engage (including third­-party advertisers) may also place their own Cookies on your hard drive. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of Cookies and does not include use of Cookies by such third parties.</p>
      <p>“Web Beacons” (also known as clear gifs or) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike Cookies, which are stored on your hard drive, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or in an email).</p>

These entities may use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Sites and other websites, including your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information.

For more information about how you can opt out of customized campaigns, please see “Your Choices” below.</p>
      <p>Security</p>
      <p>Gigamunch takes reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.

We cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to or from us over the Internet.

      <p>Native Applications on Mobile Device</p>
